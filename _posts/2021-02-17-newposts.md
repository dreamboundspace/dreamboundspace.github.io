This is just a test of what should go here. i only love you when you touch me and driving through the gated residential. ypu don't have to do it at the temple. i'm just trying to live life for the moment.

the time for the weekend is here. maybe it'll come earlier or later, we never really know. one day it may, but as of right now we just go through the motions of life and hope to come out the other side. they say things can be that simple, but we've become so jaded, so desensitized by everything that it's hard to believe it. this needs spellcheck.
