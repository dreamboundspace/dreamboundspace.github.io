i've become disillusioned with the idea of an artist website. sure i could create a squarespace website with a list of accomplishments and jpegs of art, but I wanted something more than just a trophy case to represent who I am. inspired by online spaces like myspace and kith, i used my very, very basic coding skills to build this, **dreambound**, my own space to share my ideas, interests, and dreams exactly as i imagine them.

right now I have a few ideas on what kind of content I'll be putting out here, but I'll put out updates on my [***twitter***](https://twitter.com/isaacxbizarro) as I start putting things out.

this website was built with Jekyll and is hosted on my [***github***](https://github.com/dreamboundspace/dreamboundspace.github.io), so, while I'll try to add to the code as I learn more, I would greatly appreciate any help with the code,

I really appreciate and would like to thank everyone that has given me the support to create all this. it's been a 2 year process just to get here and I really wouldn't have gotten to this point without the late night dms and fire emojis that stroked my ego enough to keep at it. Thank you.
