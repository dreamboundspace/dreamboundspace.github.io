dreambound was born out of a boredom with the traditional artist website. more social media than a trophy case, dreambound was built to be a living, breathing space where my ideas, dreams, and emotions can be seen and interacted with on a regular basis.



this website was created using jekyll and the github repository can be found ***[here](https://github.com/dreamboundspace/dreamboundspace.github.io)***. i'm not a developer so there may be a ton of bugs in the code that i'm not aware of. if you find anything that isn't working or not working as intended please let me know through the contact form or through any of the social media links down below. thanks :)
